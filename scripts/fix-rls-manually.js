  FIX FOR INFINITE RECURSION IN SUPABASE RLS POLICY
============================================================

The issue:
  Your application is experiencing an infinite recursion in the
  Row Level Security (RLS) policy for the "users" table.

  Error message: "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation \"users\""

To fix this issue manually:

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard at https://app.supabase.com/
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to SQL Editor
4. Create a "New Query"
5. Paste the SQL below into the editor
6. Click "Run" to execute the fix

SQL TO PASTE:
============================================================
${sqlFix}
============================================================

After running this SQL:
1. Restart your application
2. The infinite recursion error should be resolved
3. Your application should now be able to connect to the database properly

If issues persist, you may need to examine other RLS policies that could
be causing circular references.
